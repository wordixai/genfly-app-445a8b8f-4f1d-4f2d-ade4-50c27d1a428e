              <p>
                At edition we take dietary requirements & allergies very seriously. While we take steps to minimise 
                risk & safely handle the foods that contain potential allergens, please be advised that cross 
                contamination may occur due to factors beyond our reasonable control. At edition, we make every effort 
                to identify ingredients that may cause allergic reactions for those individuals with food allergies. 
                However we cannot guarantee completely allergy-free meals. This is due to the potential of trace 
                allergens in the working environment & supplied ingredients. Please provide as much information as 
                possible concerning any allergies & dietary requirements in advance of dining with us.
